	== How to install Eta, a Z39.50 client ==


1. Eta requires the GTK+ library, YAZ library and libxml
   library. Before you install the Eta, you must install those
   libraries. Each of them are freely available from their own sites. 

  * GTK+ library (GTK+-v2.0 or later version)
	- http://www.gtk.org/
  * YAZ library (YAZ-1.7 or later version)
	Newer version is required as possible as you can get. (We
	recommend latest version with CVS anonymous access)
	- http://www.indexdata.dk/yaz/
  ¡¦libxml library (libxml-1.8.6 or later version)
	- http://xmlsoft.org/

2. Compile. (configure and make)

	% ./configure	[RETURN]
	% make	[RETURN]

  You specify the configure's option you like. (e.g. location path of
  YAZ library)
	% ./configure --with-yazconfig=/home/masao/bin [RETURN]
	% make	[RETURN]

  Note: You get something errors with "make" of your OS's default. In
        this case, you might use the GNU make.

3. make install

	% su	[RETURN]
	Password: ******	[RETURN]
	# make install	[RETURN]

	In default settings, programs is installed following locations:
	  /usr/local/bin/eta	:Eta command (executable format)
	  
	  /usr/local/share/eta/dblist.xml	:default server list
